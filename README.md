# Grid-Project-Responsive
The website showcases a collection of my web development projects, providing visitors with an overview of my skills and accomplishments. The site features a responsive design, a project grid with images and project links, as well as a mobile-friendly navigation menu. Built using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for interactive elements.
